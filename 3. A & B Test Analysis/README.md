# üß™ A/B Testing Analysis

### üìä Project Overview
This project applies A/B testing to evaluate whether a change in business strategy, website design, or product feature leads to a statistically significant improvement in key performance metrics. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making through hypothesis testing and statistical validation.

---

### üéØ Objectives
- Design and conduct an A/B test experiment on user or customer behavior data.  
- Determine if the observed differences between control (A) and variant (B) groups are statistically significant.  
- Choose and apply appropriate statistical tests (t-test or Mann-Whitney U test).  
- Translate the statistical findings into actionable business recommendations.

---

### üß† Key Insights
- The A/B test showed **no statistically significant difference** between groups (p-value > 0.05).  
- Variations in conversion rate may be due to random chance rather than the change tested.  
- Additional testing with larger samples or refined segmentation may be required.  
- Despite similar averages, Group B displayed **lower variance**, suggesting more consistent performance.
