### 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer demographics, behaviors, and service usage patterns.  
- Identify the most influential factors contributing to churn.  
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict customer churn.  
- Provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn rates.

### 🧠 Key Insights
- **Tenure** and **Contract Type** are the strongest predictors of churn.  
- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** show the highest churn rate.  
- Higher **monthly charges** are linked to greater churn probability.  
- Providing **loyalty incentives** and **long-term plans** can significantly reduce churn.
